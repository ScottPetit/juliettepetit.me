    <h2>I feed my dog all the time at my house. I let her out when she wants to.</h2>

    <h2>I would love to take care of your pet the next time you go out of town (except snakes)!</h2>
    <h2>Pets are amazing!</h2>
    <h2>Some of my favorite pets are hamsters dogs and bunnys!</h2>
    <h2>If you want me to take care of your pet it would be $10.</h2>
    <h2>I can also make bandanas for your pets and it would be $5</h2>
